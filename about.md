# Am

I am a firstyear Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King's College London,
where I am part of the [Distributed Artificial Intelligence][DAI] research
group. My research research interests are in algorithmic game theory, mechanism
design, and other areas of theoretical computer science. I am funded by an
[EPSRC DTP studentship][epsrc-dtp].

# Was

Prior to King's I completed a BSc. and MSc. in Computer Science at the
University of Warwick. For my master's thesis I implemented a decentralised
[prediction market][prediction-markets]. During my time in the [2021 UK City of
Culture][coventry] I presented work at the [International Conference for
Undergraduate Research][ICUR] on cellular automata, and acted as a mentor for
first- and second-year computer science undergraduates.

I completed a three-month internship at [Imagination Technologies][imgtec],
where I was part of the Vulkan driver team. If you've made a Vulkan program
with index buffers using 8-bit indices, you're welcome.

# Constantly

I like any opportunity to write some code, though I am particularly fond of
computer graphics programming, and using code to solve fun puzzles. I am a big
fan of [Project Euler][project-euler] and Eric Wastl's [Advent of
Code][advent-of-code]. I am currently finishing up 2020, after which I plan on
going back and completing the rest of the years.

Me and [Lisp][common-lisp] are still in our honeymoon period and though it's
certainly not as easy to get things up and running as, say, Python, I find it
very fun to write. C also holds a special place in my heart.

I played rugby for the University of Warwick RFC First XV for all of my four
years there and currently play for my local team. I am also a big fan of the
guitar, so if your name is George then please get in touch for some chordular
enquiries.

# Who am I?

I am a firstyear Ph.D. student in Computer Science at King's College London,
where I am part of the [Distributed Artificial Intelligence][DAI] research
group. My research research interests are in algorithmic game theory, mechanism
design, and other areas of theoretical computer science. I am funded by an
[EPSRC DTP studentship][epsrc-dtp].

# Who was I?

Prior to King's I completed a BSc. and MSc. in Computer Science at the
University of Warwick. For my master's thesis I implemented a decentralised
[prediction market][prediction-markets]. During my time in the [2021 UK City of
Culture][coventry] I presented work at the [International Conference for
Undergraduate Research][ICUR] on cellular automata, and acted as a mentor for
first- and second-year computer science undergraduates.

I completed a three-month internship at [Imagination Technologies][imgtec],
where I was part of the Vulkan driver team. If you've made a Vulkan program
with index buffers using 8-bit indices, you're welcome (charitable donations
welcome).

# Other

I like any opportunity to write some code, and I am particularly fond of using
code to solve fun puzzles -- I am a big fan of [Project Euler][project-euler]
and Eric Wastl's [Advent of Code][advent-of-code]. I also like computer
graphics programming and implementing myself the various algorithms I come
across. Currently, my favourite programming language is (Common)
[Lisp][common-lisp], though I am no expert.

I played rugby for the University of Warwick RFC First XV for all of my four
years there and currently play for my local team. I like cricket too. I play
the guitar and saxophone and am a big fan of Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Frank
Zappa, and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

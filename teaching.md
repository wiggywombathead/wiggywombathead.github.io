At King's College London I have been a graduate teaching assistant for the
following modules:
- [6CCS3OME Optimization Methods][optimization-methods] (Jan-March '21)
  - single-source shortest path, all pairs shortest paths, network
	flow/congestion problems, linear programming, optimisation methods for
	NP-hard problems (heuristics, genetic algorithms, simulated annealing)

I also privately tutor for GCSE and A-level maths and computer science.

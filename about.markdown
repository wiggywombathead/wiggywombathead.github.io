Hello, I'm Tom and I am a postgraduate student in computer science at the
University of Warwick. My go-to drink is Guinness (no logo in the foam) in all
establishments but an ale festival, in which case I prefer to broaden my
horizons by trying a wide selection of the brews on offer. So far I am a fan of
the honey mead which I had at the Warwick [Real Ale Festival][real-ale] and the
Plum Porter which I tried at the [Watford RFC Beer Festival][real-beer]. I like
playing rugby and programming, and have just started learning the guitar. At
the moment I am reading The Idiot, and most often listen to Pink Floyd and The
Doors.

My academic interests revolve around theoretical computer science, in
particular algorithmic game theory and graph algorithms, but also like computer
graphics and systems programming.

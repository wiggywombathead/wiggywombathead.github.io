I'm a postgraduate student at the University of Warwick -- I like theoretical
computer science, graphics programming, David Gilmour, and books. Also
Spider-man. Expect perhaps some posts about any of those maybe.

If any of that sounds interesting, stick around. If any of that sounds
uninteresting, you're in good company, but I'll still do it anyway.

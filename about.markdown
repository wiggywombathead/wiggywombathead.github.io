Hello, I'm Tom and I am a postgraduate student in the computer science at the
University of Warwick. I enjoy playing rugby, programming, and am currently
learning to play the guitar, mostly from YouTube and through the help of
[JustinGuitar][justinguitar]. I have just finished reading the Watchmen graphic
novel and plan to watch the movie at some point. I like listening to jazz and
rock music, with a particular soft spot for Pink Floyd. I have also recently
stumbled across the group MONO and I would recommend giving them a listen.

My academic interests revolve around theoretical computer science, in
particular algorithmic game theory, in particular mechanism design and
approximation, randomisation, dynamic, and online algorithms in this context.
Computer graphics and systems programming are also fun things to get involved
with in my spare time.

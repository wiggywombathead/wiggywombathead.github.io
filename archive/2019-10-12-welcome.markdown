Got this blog (mostly) set up yesterday evening, so thought I would christen it
with its first post. [Jekyll][jekyll-home] was a bit of a pain to get going but
after a few hours of fiddling with it it does seem quite useful and think it
will continue to grow on me. You can write all the content in markdown meaning
(for now at least) I won't have to write tonnes of custom HTML and CSS and can
just focus on what I'm saying -- the default [Minima][minima-theme] is quite
nice (and haven't managed to switch to another yet), so I will stick with it
for the time being.

Just a short one for now I suppose -- I don't really know how often I'll write
these, but I'll try for once a week to begin with. The challenge will be
finding things with a consistent theme to talk about, but I suppose I will try
and stick to my academic interests and various bits of tech news.

Got this blog (mostly) set up yesterday evening, so thought I would christen it
with its first post. [Jekyll][jekyll-home] was a bit of a pain to get going but
after a few hours of fiddling with it it does seem quite useful and think it
will continue to grow on me. You can write all the content in markdown meaning
(for now at least) I won't have to write tonnes of custom HTML and CSS.

Files for blog posts are named according to the following format:
`Y-M-D-title.EXT`, where `Y` is a four-digit number, `M` and `D` are both
two-digit numbers, and `EXT` is the file extension (`markdown`, `html`, etc.).

Apparently there is also good support for code snippets:

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	puts("Hello, world!");
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

That's all for now I suppose. I don't know how often I'll write these -- I
suppose I will try for once a week to begin with, but really I ought to find
some consistent things that I can talk about.

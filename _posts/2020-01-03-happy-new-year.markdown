Hello there to whoever is reading this (most likely, me) and a happy new year
to you. Today I have a few little puzzles that are fun to work through.

This first one I read as a teaser for a job posting online: Alice, Bob, and
Carol are all applying to jobs. They send off one application per day, and each
application has a 1 in 10 chance of getting them the job (more than one person
may get a job per day). What is the expected number of days it takes for all of
them to get the job?

The second a friend posed to me after his (successful!!) interview for a
graduate scheme: 37 people live on an island. Every morning they gather to
meditate, and this is the only time they see each other during the day, and
they cannot communicate in any capacity (speech, touch, motion, etc.).
Moreover, some number of people is infected by a mysterious disease whose only
symptom is a dot on the head, visible to all but the infected person. The
disease is not at all contagious to the other inhabitants. After 12 days, some
number of islanders leave -- how many?

A third puzzle: you have two sand timers, one that measures four minutes and
one measuring seven. How do you set the timers to measure a time of nine
minutes?

That's all for now -- I hope you enjoy figuring these out.
